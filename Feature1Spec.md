# FEATURE SPECIFICATION: "What shall we play"

This is a single page app to assist in choice of which game to play.

The user selects:
 * a set of games (using a selector)
 * some number of distinct players
 * a number of players (equal to or greater than the number of players selected)

 The user then chooses criteria to rank the games by, e.g. whether the players have played the game, their rating for it,
 number of plays, and the page retrieves appropriate data and ranks eligible games by score.
