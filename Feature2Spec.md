# FEATURE SPECIFICATION: "How do I get this game?"

This is a single page app to assist in trading or buying games the user wants.

The page presents all games available for trade or sale in the user's country.
The user may limit that set of games to those that they've marked as specifically being wanted.
It is assumed that if a game is previously owned or wishlist 5 that the user doesn't want it unless they explicitly say that they do.

Games that the user wants, or users who have games to trade, may be explicitly eliminated from consideration simply by deselecting them from lists.
