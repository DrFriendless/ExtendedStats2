# ExtendedStats2

Extended Stats, rewritten in Kotlin. Sort of.

This started as an exercise in learning Kotlin, but that only took a week.
Then it turned into an exercise in learning Angular.js, but that's not so hard either.
So now I'm looking at implementing more complicated pages from Extended Stats in these technologies.
